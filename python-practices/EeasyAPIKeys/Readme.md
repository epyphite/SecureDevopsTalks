# Easy API Keys

Just a simple way to add headr api keys to protect fast when developers does have time to protect their API's endpoints.

Source the .env file as we should always create a single API key.

```bash
source .env
python EasyAPIKeys.py --webserver
```

Add click command line builder when possible, that adds more control to random programs that later on can be easily added to docker or other container virtualization technologies.
